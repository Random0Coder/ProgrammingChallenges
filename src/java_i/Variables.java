        So you've watched the video? Cool!
        Besides String, there are some other types of variables. These are not capitalized.
        - int is a type that stores whole numbers (integers).
        - double is a type that stores decimals.
        - boolean is a type that stores a value of either true or false (no quotes). They might SEEM useless, and in
          fact they are. They are completely useless and no this is not foreshadowing in any sense of the word.

        Now, declare a variable of each type (boolean, int, double, and String)
        and assign each a value.
        Then, print all of them.
