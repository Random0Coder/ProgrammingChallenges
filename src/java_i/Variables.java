        Besides String, there are some other types of variables. These are not capitalized.
        - int is a type that stores whole numbers (integers).
        - double is a type that stores decimals.
        - boolean is a type that stores either true or false (no quotes).

        Now, declare a variable of each type (boolean, int, double, and String)
        and assign each a value.
        Then, print all of them.
